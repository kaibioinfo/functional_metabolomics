# Functional Metabolomics with SIRIUS

The next SIRIUS version (SIRIUS 6.1) will have builtin support for filtering molecular structure annotations with functional metabolomics annotations. For the short time until the next version of SIRIUS is released, we offer a small jupyter notebook that shows how to use MZMine and Functional Metabolomics to filter SIRIUS candidate lists for better annotation rates.
